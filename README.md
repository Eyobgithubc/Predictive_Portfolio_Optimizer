Project Title: Predictive Portfolio Optimizer
Description:

The Predictive Portfolio Optimizer project is designed to leverage advanced time series forecasting techniques to optimize investment portfolios. 
In this project, I focus on analyzing historical financial data from key assets—Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), 
and S&P 500 ETF (SPY)—to predict future market trends and enhance portfolio performance. 
The goal is to provide actionable insights for maximizing returns while minimizing risks through data-driven investment strategies.

Key Objectives:

Forecast Market Trends: Using time series models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), 
the project forecasts the future price movements of Tesla, BND, and SPY. The forecasts aim to capture short-term fluctuations, long-term trends, and market volatility, providing valuable predictions for portfolio adjustments.

Portfolio Optimization: The project applies advanced portfolio optimization techniques to balance risk and return. 
By using forecasts of asset prices, I optimize the allocation of assets in a sample portfolio to maximize the Sharpe ratio, which measures risk-adjusted return, and minimize potential losses through Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis.

Risk Management and Analysis: In addition to price forecasting, I conduct thorough risk analysis, including volatility assessment, rolling windows for short-term fluctuations, and evaluation of extreme events or outliers in returns. 
This helps in understanding potential risks and adjusting the portfolio to maintain a balanced risk profile.

Techniques Used:
Time Series Forecasting: Applying ARIMA/SARIMA for classical statistical modeling and LSTM for capturing long-term dependencies in market data.

Portfolio Optimization: Using Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Sharpe Ratio maximization to find the optimal asset allocation.

Risk Metrics: Value-at-Risk (VaR) and portfolio volatility calculations to measure potential losses and the impact of asset fluctuations.

Outcome: The project demonstrates how predictive modeling and portfolio optimization can be integrated to create data-driven investment strategies. 
By forecasting market trends and adjusting portfolio allocations accordingly, the tool helps in achieving higher returns while controlling for risk. 
The final result is a robust portfolio model that adapts to market conditions, helping investors make more informed decisions.
